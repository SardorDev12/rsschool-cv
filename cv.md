## About me:

When I finished a public school, I had no idea what programming is. Then I started studying at Westminster International University in Tashkent. In the second semester, I learned making some games in Scratch. Soon, they taught us HTML and CSS so we were able to make some simple websites.

From the second year at the University, I chose Information systems as I had an interest in programming after learning HTML, CSS. I continued my learning with JavaScript.

At the University, I also studied Game Development in Unity and Mobile Application Development in Andorid Studio in with Kotlin.

Besides programming, I am keen on creating fancy looking designs. With the help of PhotoShop, I made so many photo edits but all of them are just for my interests.

I have one year of experience in Accounting so I can easily work in Excel and 1C.
